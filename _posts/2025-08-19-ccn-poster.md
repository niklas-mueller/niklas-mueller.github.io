At CCN 2025 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, I presented the following poster: [CCN Poster 2024]({{ '/assets/posters/CCN25_Mueller_URF.pdf' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}.

Together with Marianne de Heer Kloots and Thirza Dado, I was part of the local organization committee.
At the CCN Social Event, we organized an artistic performance by the [AIAR Collective](https://aiarcollective.com/).
