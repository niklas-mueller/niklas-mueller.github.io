At CCN 2025 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, I presented the following poster: [CCN Poster 2024]({{ '/assets/posters/CCN25_Mueller_URF.pdf' | relative_url }}){:target="_blank"}. The 2-page abtract can be found [here](https://2025.ccneuro.org/poster/?id=1oPisnGthO). I was also involved in [this project](https://2025.ccneuro.org/poster/?id=lTeHj3YYjA) by master student Yifan Luo.

Together with Marianne de Heer Kloots and Thirza Dado, I was part of the local [organization committee](https://2025.ccneuro.org/ccn-organizers/).
At the CCN Social Event, we organized an artistic performance by the [AIAR Collective](https://aiarcollective.com/).
