        Using encoding models that map spatial activations of deep neural networks onto EEG data we show that foveal and peripheral information are processed at distinct points in time.
        Strikingly, a empiricially-based model of the distribution of retinal ganglion cells in the human can enhance the encoding model and holistically predict the EEG signal across the full time course as well as across the whole scalp!

        We  develop a new method and show that abundant retinotopic information can be recovered from EEG signals: in an iterative procedure, we randomly sample pixels of the DNN activation maps that are used to make the encoding prediction and thereby, iteratively build up a pixel-wise importance map of each spatial location to the encoding model performance.
