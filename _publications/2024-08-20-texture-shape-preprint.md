        When toddlers interact with objects in the their environment, they typically hold them close to their face. Thus, object rather often occupy a large part of the visual field of toddlers which can be compared to a zoom-in on the object.
        In this paper, we test whether taking this simplification serious, has an effect on the texture-shape-bias of deep neural networks (DNNs).

        We find that shape-bias increases when DNNs are trained on close-up object images and even develop a stronger, human-like shape-bias when cue-conflict test images contain less background information.
        We indentify the tuning to background features as one of the main drivers of the previously found texture-bias of DNNs consistent with the idea that DNNs use highly available information (like background) over relevant information (like object shape or even texture) as a form of shortcut learning.
