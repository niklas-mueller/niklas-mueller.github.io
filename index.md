I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam with [Iris I. A. Groen]{https://sites.google.com/view/irisgroen} and H. Steven Scholte.

In my research, I leverage methods from Machine Learning, specifically Computer Vision, in combination with state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques to study the underlying principles of human visual processing. I work in close collaboration with the Cognitive AI and Vision Amsterdam (CAVA) lab at the [Brain and Cognition Group]{https://psyres.uva.nl/content/research-groups/programme-group-brain-and-cognition/programme-group-brain-and-cognition.html} (Psychology Department), the [Video and Image Sense Lab (VISlab)]{https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/} at the Informatics Institute, both at the University of Amsterdam. My project is embedded in and funded by the Interdisciplinary PhD Program of the UvA Data Science Center.
